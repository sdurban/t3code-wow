# T3 Code for World of Warcraft

Watch and run your [T3 Code](https://t3.codes) agent threads without leaving the game. It's a native addon for World of Warcraft: Forever, built from Blizzard's own UI templates so it looks and plays like the rest of the interface, plus a small bridge that connects it to T3 Code.

> [!WARNING]
> **Early release, still experimental.** It's built for and tested on one setup: **Omarchy 4.5.0**, **T3 Code Nightly** (0.1.7-nightly) and **World of Warcraft: Forever** (1.60.x) under Proton. Other setups may work but aren't supported yet. T3 Code Nightly's API changes often, so a T3 update can break things until this catches up. Expect rough edges, and please [report them](https://github.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/issues).

## What it does

- **T3 Code window** (`/t3`): your threads grouped into Working, Open and Settled, filtered by project or machine. Read a thread, reply, queue follow-ups, stop a run, settle or reopen it, start new threads, answer the agent's questions and approve its requests.
- **Quest tracker**: what's running, what needs you and what just finished, right under your quests, with live timers.
- **Notices**: a toast, a sound and a chat line when a thread finishes or needs you. They wait until combat ends, and stay quiet in dungeons and raids if you like.
- **Full controller support**: the D-pad moves between controls, A selects, B goes back, LB/RB switch tabs, X reads aloud and holding Y dictates. Hold both triggers and press Back to open it from anywhere.
- **Voice**: dictate replies with Omarchy's dictation, and have replies read aloud by your desktop voice or the game's.
- **Screenshots**: attach what's on your screen to a message so the agent can see your game.
- **Every machine**: threads from your other computers via T3 Connect, all in one list.
- **Usage**: your providers' plans and limits, the same as Omarchy's Agents panel shows.
- A minimap button and a game-menu entry, for opening it without a keyboard.

## Requirements

- **Omarchy 4.5.0** (Hyprland). The bridge reads the game window with Hyprland's screen capture, and dictation and usage come from Omarchy's own tools.
- **T3 Code Nightly**, installed and running. Its `t3` command gives the bridge a login.
- **World of Warcraft: Forever**, installed with Omarchy's Battle.net (Proton).
- **Node.js 22** or newer.
- **Game sound on.** The addon learns about new updates through silent sounds; with sound off it falls back to slower polling.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/main/install.sh | bash
```

Run the same command again to update. It finds World of Warcraft: Forever in Omarchy's Battle.net, or wherever Battle.net installed it (for anything unusual, add `bash -s -- --wow "/path/to/World of Warcraft"`). It installs the addon into the game, gives the bridge a T3 Code session limited to reading and running threads, and starts the bridge as the `t3code-wow` user service.

Then it tells you what to do in the game and waits until the game checks in. The first time, **fully quit and restart World of Warcraft**: the game only finds new addon folders when it starts. After that, updates only need a `/reload`.

To install from a clone instead, run `./install.sh` in it.

### Windows (experimental)

Use Node.js 22 or newer and run these commands from the checkout in PowerShell. Give `--wow` the folder that contains `_forever_`, or the `_forever_` folder itself.

```powershell
node .\bridge\bin\t3code-wow.js install --wow 'C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft'
```

On the machine running T3 Code, issue a session for the bridge with `t3 auth session issue --scope orchestration:read --scope orchestration:operate --ttl 30d --label 'WoW bridge Windows' --token-only`. For a remote machine, use an HTTPS origin or an SSH tunnel. For a T3 Code server on a Mac listening on loopback, open the tunnel with `ssh -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 127.0.0.1:43773:127.0.0.1:MAC_T3_PORT USER@MAC_HOST` and keep that terminal open. Set `T3_ORIGIN` to the address the bridge can reach and enter the token privately as `T3_TOKEN` in the Windows PowerShell session. For example, in PowerShell 7:

```powershell
$env:T3_ORIGIN = 'http://127.0.0.1:43773' # Example local SSH forward
$env:T3_TOKEN = Read-Host 'T3 Code session token' -MaskInput
try { node .\bridge\bin\t3code-wow.js run } finally { Remove-Item Env:T3_TOKEN }
```

Start or fully restart WoW: Forever after installing the addon and slots. Keep the game in the foreground so the bridge can read its pixels. Open `/t3` after logging in and use `/t3 selftest` to check the link. Run the bridge from an open terminal on Windows. Voice playback uses the game's text-to-speech where available. Omarchy's dictation and usage integrations are unavailable on Windows.

### Uninstall

```bash
t3code-wow uninstall
```

This removes the addon and its update folders, its settings in the game, the bridge service, the bridge's T3 Code sessions (here and on any machine you added) and its files.

## Using it

- `/t3` opens or closes the window. You can also use the minimap button, the game menu (Esc), or hold both triggers and press Back on a controller.
- `/t3 new` starts a thread, `/t3 usage` opens the usage tab, `/t3 settings` the settings.
- `/t3 unlock` lets you drag the tracker section somewhere else; Settings → Reset tracker puts it back under your quests.
- To see threads from another machine on your tailnet, run `t3code-wow env add <host>`. It finds the machine's T3 Code over Tailscale and creates a session for the bridge over SSH.

## Commands

```bash
t3code-wow status         # what the bridge sees: T3 Code, the game, the screen link, the addon
t3code-wow status --log   # the same, with recent log lines
t3code-wow env            # other machines shown in game (add <host> / remove <name>)
t3code-wow uninstall      # remove everything (see above)
```

## When something's wrong

1. Run `t3code-wow status --log` and check each line.
2. In game, run `/t3 selftest`. It checks each step between the game and T3 Code and says which one fails.
3. `/t3 report` fills the T3 Code message box with diagnostics and attaches a screenshot of your game. Send it to an agent, or copy the text into an issue.

If the tracker says live updates are paused, do a `/reload`: the game allows a fixed number of updates per session (1,200 by default), which normally lasts many hours.

## How it works

Addons can't open network connections or read files, so the addon and the bridge talk through what the game does allow:

| Direction | How |
| --- | --- |
| Game → bridge | A small strip of coloured squares in the top-left corner for about a second after you do something. The bridge reads it with a screen capture. |
| Bridge → game | Load-on-demand "slot" addons. The game reads a slot's Lua from disk when it loads, so the bridge writes a fresh snapshot there first. |
| "New data" signal | Large silent sound files the bridge fills or empties. The game re-reads big sounds every time it plays them, so the addon knows when to load the next slot. |

The bridge talks to T3 Code over the same WebSocket API its apps use. Details, measurements and design decisions are in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

- **The strip is encrypted.** Streams and recordings show it, so every frame is encrypted and authenticated (ChaCha20 and HMAC-SHA-256) with a key only the bridge and your addon have. To anyone else it's noise, and the bridge ignores anything it can't authenticate.
- **Addon managers.** WowUp shows a single "T3 Code" entry. Leave the `T3Code_S###` folders alone: the addon needs them.
- **Nothing else.** The addon never sends anything to Blizzard. The bridge doesn't read game memory or press keys for you; it reads pixels and writes files in the addon folder.
