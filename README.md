# T3 Code for World of Warcraft

Watch and run your [T3 Code](https://t3.codes) agent threads without leaving the game. It's a native addon for World of Warcraft: Forever, built from Blizzard's own UI templates so it looks and plays like the rest of the interface, plus a small bridge that connects it to T3 Code.

> [!WARNING]
> **Early release, still experimental.** Upstream targets Omarchy 4.5.0 with WoW: Forever 1.60.x under Proton and also documents macOS and CachyOS. This fork adds Windows support on `windows-bridge`. T3 Code Nightly's API can change between releases.

## What it does

- **T3 Code window** (`/t3`): your threads grouped into Working, Open and Settled, filtered by project or machine. Read a thread, reply, steer a working thread or queue follow-ups, stop a run, settle or reopen it, start new threads, answer the agent's questions and approve its requests.
- **Quest tracker**: what's running, what needs you and what just finished, right under your quests, with live timers.
- **Notices**: a toast, a sound and a chat line when a thread finishes or needs you. They wait until combat ends, and stay quiet in dungeons and raids if you like.
- **Full controller support**: the D-pad moves between controls, A selects, B goes back, LB/RB switch tabs, X reads aloud and holding Y dictates. Hold both triggers and press Back to open it from anywhere.
- **Voice**: dictate replies with Omarchy's dictation, and have replies read aloud by your desktop voice (on macOS, the system voice) or the game's.
- **Screenshots**: attach what's on your screen to a message so the agent can see your game.
- **Every machine**: threads from your other computers via T3 Connect, all in one list.
- **Usage**: your providers' plans and limits, the same as Omarchy's Agents panel shows.
- A minimap button and a game-menu entry, for opening it without a keyboard.

## Install on Windows

You need WoW: Forever, a running T3 Code Nightly server using orchestration protocol 2, Git for Windows, and Node.js 22 or newer. Reopen PowerShell after installing Node so it picks up the updated PATH. [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) · [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

```powershell
git clone --branch windows-bridge https://github.com/sdurban/t3code-wow.git
cd t3code-wow
.\T3Code-WoW.cmd
```

1. Choose **Install or update**. Press Enter to accept the detected WoW folder, or enter the path to your WoW folder, `_forever_`, or `Interface\AddOns`.
2. If T3 Code runs on another computer on your LAN, enable **Network access** on that computer under **Settings → Sharing & access**. Create a one-time pairing link on the T3 Code host. [T3 Code remote access](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/main/docs/user/remote-access.md#pair-over-a-lan-or-private-network)

   ```bash
   t3 pair --scope orchestration:read --scope orchestration:operate --label 'WoW bridge Windows'
   ```

3. Choose **Start bridge** and paste the full web pairing URL with `/pair#token=…` into the hidden prompt. Use an HTTPS URL or an HTTP URL with a private IP address. A loopback URL works when T3 Code runs on the same computer. The launcher saves the session encrypted for your Windows account. Press Enter on later starts to reconnect, or paste a fresh link if the session expires or the host address changes. Keep the bridge running while you play.
4. On the first install, fully close and reopen WoW: Forever so it finds the addon and its update slots. Keep the `T3Code_S###` folders installed. Log in, bring WoW to the foreground, and type `/t3`. Game sound enables faster updates. With sound off, the addon polls for changes.

### Update on Windows

Stop the bridge with Ctrl+C, run `git pull --ff-only` in the checkout, and choose **Install or update** again. Start the bridge and press Enter to reuse your saved session. Follow the installer's **Next** instruction for WoW. Usually this is `/reload`, but a full restart is needed when the installer adds slot folders or signal files that WoW needs to discover at launch.

### Windows commands and diagnostics

The menu also accepts commands from PowerShell.

```powershell
.\T3Code-WoW.cmd install -WowPath 'C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft'
.\T3Code-WoW.cmd start
.\T3Code-WoW.cmd status
```

Use **Status** and `/t3 selftest` to check the link. If live updates are paused because the slots ran out, use `/reload`.

To test screen capture, run the delayed probe below, then switch back to WoW and open `/t3` or select a thread before the capture. The game must be in the foreground. The strip is only drawn while WoW is waiting for the bridge to acknowledge an action.

```powershell
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3; .\T3Code-WoW.cmd probe
```

To uninstall, stop the bridge, close WoW, choose **Uninstall**, and confirm. This removes the addon, its slots, and the local settings. Revoke the Windows session on the T3 Code host under **Settings → Sharing & access** to end its access.

## Requirements

The following requirements and shell installer apply to Linux and macOS.

- **Omarchy 4.5.0** (Hyprland), **CachyOS** with KDE Plasma (see [CachyOS and KDE Plasma](#cachyos-and-kde-plasma)), or **macOS** (see [macOS](#macos)). On Omarchy the bridge reads the game window with Hyprland's screen capture, and dictation and usage come from Omarchy's own tools.
- **T3 Code Nightly**, installed and running. Its `t3` command gives the bridge a login.
- **World of Warcraft: Forever**, installed with Battle.net: Omarchy's Battle.net (Proton), Battle.net in Faugus Launcher, Lutris or Steam on CachyOS, or the native Mac app.
- **Node.js 22** or newer.
- **Game sound on.** The addon learns about new updates through silent sounds; with sound off it falls back to slower polling.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/main/install.sh | bash
```

It finds World of Warcraft: Forever in Omarchy's Battle.net, in the prefixes Faugus Launcher and Lutris recorded, or wherever Battle.net installed it (for anything unusual, add `bash -s -- --wow "/path/to/World of Warcraft"`). It installs the addon into the game, gives the bridge a T3 Code session limited to reading and running threads, and starts the bridge as the `t3code-wow` user service.

Then it tells you what to do in the game and waits until the game checks in. The first time, **fully quit and restart World of Warcraft**: the game only finds new addon folders when it starts. After that, updates only need a `/reload`.

To install from a clone instead, run `./install.sh` in it.

### Update

Run the same install command again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/main/install.sh | bash
```

It downloads the latest version, replaces the installed copy and restarts the bridge, keeping your settings, T3 Code session and machines. Then type `/reload` in game; the installer tells you when an update needs a full game restart instead. To install a specific release, pipe to `T3CODE_WOW_REF=v0.2.0 bash` instead of `bash`. From a clone, `git pull` and run `./install.sh` again.

### macOS

The same install command works on a Mac with the native WoW: Forever client. Install Node.js 22 first (`brew install node`). The installer finds the game in `/Applications/World of Warcraft` or wherever Battle.net put it, and runs the bridge as a launch agent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/t3code-wow.plist`) instead of a systemd service.

- **Screen Recording permission.** The bridge reads the strip with macOS's `screencapture`, so it needs Screen Recording. The first time it runs, macOS asks, or lists `node` switched off under System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording. Turn it on, then restart the bridge with `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/t3code-wow`. If the link stays down, `t3code-wow status` names the exact `node` it needs. The permission belongs to that `node` binary, so other programs that run with it can record the screen too. After you upgrade Node, macOS asks again for the new one.
- **Display settings.** Run the game at the display's full resolution (its Retina resolution on a Retina display), fullscreen or windowed. A resolution the display stretches blurs the strip.
- **Speech** uses the system voice (`say`). **Dictation** isn't available on macOS yet, and the Usage tab shows what T3 Code reports.
- `~/.local/bin` isn't on a Mac's PATH by default. The installer says so; add it to your shell profile, or run `~/.local/bin/t3code-wow`.

### CachyOS and KDE Plasma

The same install command works on CachyOS (or another Arch system) running KDE Plasma 6. Install Node.js first (`sudo pacman -S nodejs`). The installer finds Battle.net in any prefix Faugus Launcher or Lutris knows about, in `~/Faugus`, or in Steam, Bottles and Heroic prefixes.

- **Screen link.** KWin doesn't support the screen capture `grim` uses, so the bridge reads the game through KWin's own D-Bus screenshot interface with `busctl`, which ships with systemd. There's nothing to install or allow. The game must be on the current virtual desktop and not minimized.
- **Screenshots** come out as JPEG when ImageMagick is installed (`sudo pacman -S imagemagick`), and as PNG otherwise.
- **Speech** needs a desktop voice: `sudo pacman -S speech-dispatcher espeak-ng`. **Dictation** uses `voxtype` with `pw-record` if you have them. The Usage tab shows what T3 Code reports.
- Other desktops on CachyOS: Hyprland works like Omarchy (install `grim`), and an X11 session uses ImageMagick's `import`. GNOME isn't supported, since it doesn't let other programs capture the screen without asking every time.

### Uninstall

```bash
t3code-wow uninstall
```

This removes the addon and its update folders, its settings in the game, the bridge service (or launch agent), the bridge's T3 Code sessions (here and on any machine you added) and its files. On macOS, also turn `node` off under Screen & System Audio Recording: uninstalling can't do that for you.

## Using it

- `/t3` opens or closes the window. You can also use the minimap button, the game menu (Esc), or hold both triggers and press Back on a controller.
- `/t3 new` starts a thread, `/t3 usage` opens the usage tab, `/t3 settings` the settings.
- The model selector is in the thread header. The reasoning control appears alongside it for models that offer reasoning levels.
- `/t3 unlock` lets you drag the tracker section somewhere else; Settings → Reset tracker puts it back under your quests.
- On Linux and macOS, use `t3code-wow env add <host>` to add a machine on your tailnet. It finds the machine's T3 Code over Tailscale and creates a session for the bridge over SSH.

## Commands

On Windows, use the [Windows launcher commands](#windows-commands-and-diagnostics).

```bash
t3code-wow status         # what the bridge sees: T3 Code, the game, the screen link, the addon
t3code-wow status --log   # the same, with recent log lines
t3code-wow env            # other machines shown in game (add <host> / remove <name>)
t3code-wow uninstall      # remove everything (see above)
```

## When something's wrong

1. On Windows, choose **Status** in the launcher. On Linux and macOS, run `t3code-wow status --log`.
2. In game, run `/t3 selftest`. It checks each step between the game and T3 Code and says which one fails.
3. `/t3 report` fills the T3 Code message box with diagnostics and attaches a screenshot of your game. Send it to an agent, or copy the text into an issue.

If the tracker says live updates are paused, do a `/reload`: the game allows a fixed number of updates per session (1,200 by default), which normally lasts many hours.

## How it works

Addons can't open network connections or read files, so the addon and the bridge talk through what the game does allow:

| Direction | How |
| --- | --- |
| Game → bridge | A small strip of coloured squares in the top-left corner for about a second after you do something. The bridge reads it with a screen capture (`grim` on Hyprland, KWin's D-Bus screenshot interface on KDE Plasma, `screencapture` on macOS, or Win32 foreground capture on Windows). |
| Bridge → game | Load-on-demand "slot" addons. The game reads a slot's Lua from disk when it loads, so the bridge writes a fresh snapshot there first. |
| "New data" signal | Large silent sound files the bridge fills or empties. The game re-reads big sounds every time it plays them, so the addon knows when to load the next slot. |

The bridge talks to T3 Code over the same WebSocket API its apps use. Details, measurements and design decisions are in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

- **The strip is encrypted.** Streams and recordings show it, so every frame is encrypted and authenticated (ChaCha20 and HMAC-SHA-256) with a key only the bridge and your addon have. To anyone else it's noise, and the bridge ignores anything it can't authenticate.
- **Addon managers.** WowUp shows a single "T3 Code" entry. Leave the `T3Code_S###` folders alone: the addon needs them.
- **Nothing else.** The addon never sends anything to Blizzard. The bridge doesn't read game memory or press keys for you; it reads pixels and writes files in the addon folder.
